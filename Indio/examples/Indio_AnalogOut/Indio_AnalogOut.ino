/* Indio Library, by Rustem Iskuzhin for Industruino - wwww.industruino.com
This library enables communication with the Industruino IND.I/O Baseboard.
The IND.I/O Baseboard has 8CH of 24V digital I/O (6.5-32V supported), 4CH 0-10V/4-20mA ADC, 2CH 0-10V/4-20mA DAC, RS485 transceiver.


WARNING!: PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CONNECTING PERIPHERALS TO YOUR IND.I/O AND CONFIGURING THE DIRECTION OF THE I/O.
          THE FAILURE MODE OF A 24V SHORTED CONNECTION IS MUCH MORE SPECTACULAR THAN WHEN WORKING AT 5V. 


Please find the calibration data array inside the Indio.cpp library file, together with an explanation on how to perform the calibration. 
Library is preloaded with calibration data but characterisctics are board specific thus reading with standard cal. data might be off.
